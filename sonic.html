<p>Sonic the Hedgehog (Japanese: ソニック・ザ・ヘッジホッグ Hepburn: Sonikku za Hejjihoggu?), trademarked Sonic The Hedgehog,[5] is the title character and protagonist of the Sonic the Hedgehog series released by Sega, as well as numerous spin-off comics, five animated shows, and an animated OVA.

Sonic is a blue anthropomorphic hedgehog who has the ability to run at supersonic speeds and the ability to curl into a ball, primarily to attack enemies. Throughout the course of the video games, Sonic most commonly has to race through levels, collect power up rings and survive against a host of natural obstacles and minions to achieve his goal. While many individuals at Sega had a hand in Sonic's creation, programmer Yuji Naka and artist Naoto Ohshima are generally credited with the creation of the character.[6]

The first game was released on June 23, 1991, to provide Sega with a mascot to rival Nintendo's flagship character Mario (see 1991 in video gaming).[7][8] Since then, Sonic has become one of the world's best-known video game characters, with his series selling more than 80 million copies.[9] In 2005, Sonic was one of the first game character inductees into the Walk of Game, alongside Mario and Link.[10]</p>

<p>Doctor Ivo "Eggman" Robotnik (ドクター・エッグマン Dokutā Egguman?, ロボトニック Robotonikku)[4] is a video game character and the main antagonist of the Sonic the Hedgehog series, created by Sega. He is a rotund mad scientist who plans to conquer the world in order to build his own Eggman Empire, and is the archenemy of Sonic the Hedgehog. His original character designer was Naoto Ohshima, and while he has gone through several major and minor appearance changes throughout the series, his in-game designs retain several basic characteristics, such as his egg-shaped body, red-black-yellow clothing, pince-nez sunglasses, and large mustache.

Eggman has appeared in almost every Sonic the Hedgehog video game since his first appearance in the 1991 title Sonic the Hedgehog and is also a prominent character in other Sonic media, including comics, novels, animated TV series and an original video animation.</p>

<center><img class="sonic4 wow fadeIn animated" data-wow-delay="0s" src="sonic/sonic5.png" ></center>
<p>Miles Prower (マイルス・パウアー Mairusu Pauā?), more commonly known by his nickname Tails (テイルス Teirusu?), is a fictional character in Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series. He is a significant main character after the title character Sonic, who is also his best friend. Tails also appears in his own spin-off series in comic books, cartoons, as well as in an OVA.

The name "Miles Prower" is a pun on "miles per hour", a reference to the famed speed of Sonic the Hedgehog. He is an eight-year-old[1] fox with two tails,[2] hence the nickname. He is known to be Sonic's sidekick and best friend[2] as well as a mechanical genius.[2] He is able to use his two tails to propel himself into the air like a helicopter for a limited time.[2] He debuted on October 16, 1992, with the release of the 8-bit version of Sonic the Hedgehog 2; the 16-bit version was released that November.

When he was first introduced in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Tails's fur was orange. The color was changed to yellow-orange for Sonic Adventure, and later to light yellow for Sonic Heroes. In 1993 and 1995 he starred in his own games: Tails and the Music Maker for the Pico; Tails Adventure, and Tails' Skypatrol for the Game Gear. Tails is the third most popular character of the series, behind Sonic and Shadow, according to an official poll.[3]</p>

<p>Amy Rose (エミー・ローズ・ザ·ヘッジホッグ Emī Rōzu za Hejjihoggu?, lit. Amy Rose the Hedgehog), originally nicknamed Rosy the Rascal, is a fictional character in Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series. She is a pink anthropomorphic hedgehog with a cheerful, competitive personality. Amy is known for her unrequited and obsessive love for the series' main character Sonic. They have saved each other's lives on a number of occasions, however, and are good friends. During the series' early years, her appearance changed several times.

Amy debuted in the Sonic the Hedgehog manga series created by Kenji Terada in 1992. Her first video-game appearance was in 1993's Sonic the Hedgehog CD and she was first playable in 1994's Sonic Drift. Amy has become one of the series' most popular and recognizable characters, appearing in dozens of main-series and spinoff titles, several comic book series, the anime Sonic X, and the computer-animated Sonic Boom. She has received a mixed response from critics. Although some found her cute and powerful, others criticized her for her voice acting and personality. She has frequently appeared in Sonic merchandise.</p>
